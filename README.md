Here is a simple example to teach about machine learning, programming using 
BBC Micro:Bit and controlling a servo motor. The robotic arm can be controlled 
by showing different images to a webcam connected to a PC. The machine learning 
algorithm recognizes the command and sends it to the microbit over a virtual 
serial port. The Micro:Bit can be programmed to move the servo motor based on 
the commands received.

This project is heavily based on https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com


Steps:
1. Create the Machine learning model

2. Create script to read camera, recognize and notify microcontroller over serial port

3. Create servo motor control program for microcrontroller to perform desired action based on serial port message
